```{r message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(UsingR)

data(babies)
```

In this document we will be using the `babies` data frame, which is available through the `UsingR` library. After running the code above, if you write `?babies` in your Console, you would find the descriptions for each variable. Note that by making visualizations we are exploring what we see, we will not jump to conclusions yet!

Throughout the exercises, make sure you use a reasonable font size and label axes. You are welcome to use colors and themes whenever you would like. Adhere to tidyverse style guide.

Run the code below to drop observations with unknown values for variables of interest and to recategorize two variables. In this analysis we will use the `babies_filtered` data frame instead of `babies`.
```{r}
babies_filtered <- babies %>% 
  filter(wt != 999) %>% 
  filter(age != 99) %>% 
  filter(gestation != 999) %>% 
  filter(smoke != 9) %>% 
  filter(ed != 9) %>% 
  mutate(smoke = factor(
    smoke,
    levels = c(0, 1, 2, 3),
    labels = c("Never smoked", "Smokes now", "Until pregnancy", "Not anymore")
  )) %>% 
  mutate(ed = factor(
    case_when(
      ed %in% 0:1 ~ "Did not graduate HS",
      ed == 2 ~ "High School graduate",
      ed %in% 3:7 ~ "Education beyond HS"
    ),
    levels = c("Did not graduate HS", "High School graduate", "Education beyond HS")
  ))
```


## Question 1

How many observations and variables are there? What does each observation represent? Answer with inline code when appropriate.

**Answer**

There are `r nrow(babies_filtered)` observations and `r ncol(babies_filtered)` variables in the data set. An observation pertains to a single baby.


## Question 2 

Say we wanted to explore length of gestation by mother's smoking habit. Would a scatter plot be an appropriate plot? If not, suggest a plot that would be. Explain your answer either way.

**Answer**

Length of gestation is a continuous variable and mother's smoking habit is a discrete variable. A scatter plot is for two continuous variables so no it would not be appropriate. A box plot of length of gestation for each category of mother's smoking habit would be appropriate.


## Question 3

Suppose you had intuition that a baby's birth weight was related to the age of it's mother at the time of the baby's birth. Which would be the response variable and which would be the explanatory variable? 

Make a plot to examine the relationship between mother's age and baby's birth weight, with the explanatory and response variables on the appropriate axes.

**Answer**

The mother's age at the time of the baby's birth would not differ due the the baby's birth weight, but it conceivable that the baby's birth weight could be influenced by the mother's age. So the mother's age at the time of delivery would be the explanatory variable while the birth weight would be the response variable.

```{r}
babies_filtered %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = wt)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Mother's age at delivery") +
  ylab("Baby's birth weight (ounces)")
```



## Question 4

Use `babies_filtered` to remake this plot.

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("question4-plot.png")
```

**Answer**

```{r}
babies_filtered %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gestation, y = wt)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(smoke ~ ed) +
  xlab("Length of gestation (days)") +
  ylab("Birth weight (ounces)")
```
