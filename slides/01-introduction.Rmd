## Survey

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[From what we've asked you]

Today's participants:

- represent a wide array of institutions
- teach classes of varied sizes

The **variety of your experiences** will be very helpful for us to learn improvements that can make gradetools even more helpful!

## Survey

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[From what we've asked you]

At least half of you teach a course that involves some computing

- This is great because gradetools was made to be compatible with **computing assignments**

- We are working on a new and improved version of gradetools, which **will include** compatibility with **pdfs**!

]
.panel[.panel-name[What we should've asked you]

- Do you feel at least moderately comfortable with RStudio?
- Have you brought your own student submissions to grade?
- Have you ever used GitHub?
- Have you ever used GitHub for your class?

The gradetools package 

- .emph[automates] the repetitive .emph[administrative tasks] in the grading workflow 

--

- minimizes switching between different interfaces

--

- .emph[saves time for] more meaningful tasks that require .emph[pedagogical decisions].

## Example: a homework

--

_Many of the following questions will be based on the **bike rental data** in Los Angeles. The data represents all bike rides from Metro Bike Share company in April-June of 2019._

_The data and a description of each variable can be found at (https://bikeshare.metro.net/about/data/)._

_Throughout the homework, make sure you use a reasonable font size and **label axes**. You are welcome to use colors and themes whenever you would like. Adhere to tidyverse style guide._

---

## Example: a homework

_**Question 1**_

_How many observations and variables are there? What does each observation represent? Answer with inline code when appropriate._

--

_**Question 2**_

_Make a plot that shows the number of rentals by each pass type._

--

_**Question 3**_

_Does bike type preference seem to vary by passholder type? Make a plot and refer to it in your answer to this question._
