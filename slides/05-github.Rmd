## Why use GitHub for a course?

- reproducibility, version control, collaboration

--

- students can learn GitHub _by using it_

--

- we can easily share individualized feedback with students

--

- package [ghclass](https://rundel.github.io/ghclass/)<sup>1</sup> makes it easy to manage courses on GitHub using R
