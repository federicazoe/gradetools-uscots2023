## Adding a rubric item 

.pull-left[

- A rubric item can be added while grading
- The user would be prompted to supply all relevant rubric components

]

.pull-right[

<img src="figures/adding-rubric-item.png" alt="A picture of gradetool's prompting user to grade first question from the main demo. A blue box surrounds the additional grading options." style="width:100%;">

]


---

class: middle

## Editing the rubric 

- Prompt messages, feedback messages, and points to remove/add call all be edited directly in the rubric
- Changes would be reflected once the grading function is rerun

--

<span style="color: orange;">
  Prompt codes cannot ever be changed because they are used to store grading progress
</span>

## Providing personalized feedback

A grader can write a message to a student's feedback file without having points associated

.pull-left[
It can pertain to a certain question

<img src="figures/adding-personalized-feedback.png" alt="A picture of gradetool's prompting user to grade question 1, from the main demo. A blue box surrounds the additional grading option 'Provide a personalized feedback message." style="width:100%;">

]

.pull-right[
Or to the assignment overall

## Hands-on session: using extra prompt options

- Grade another submission to practice adding rubric items and writing personalized feedback where appropriate
- Note: Running the same `assist_grading()` call will resume grading progress

---

## Selective grading 

- `assist_advanced_grading()` operates identically to `assist_grading()`, with a few extra options

--

- One extra is the ability to specify which students and which questions to grade
  - E.g. grade question 1 for all students
  
--

- These arguments are specified as character vectors
  - `questions_to_grade` must be question names present in rubric
  - `students_to_grade` must be student identifiers present in roster

---

class: middle

## Selective grading example

```{r, eval = FALSE}
assist_advanced_grading(
  rubric_path = "rubric-full.csv", 
  roster_path = "roster-minimal.csv", 
  grading_progress_log_path = "quiz01-grading-progress-log.csv", 
  final_grade_sheet_path = "quiz01-final-grade-sheet.csv", 
  example_student_identifier = "BaronPoisson",
  example_assignment_path = "quiz01/quiz01-BaronPoisson.Rmd", 
  example_feedback_path = "quiz01/quiz01-BaronPoisson-feedback.Rmd",
  {{questions_to_grade = "Question 1", }}
  {{students_to_grade = c("BaronPoisson", "sergent-gamma")}}
)
```

---

## Regrading

- `assist_regrading()` allows graders to specify which students and questions to regrade

--

- Grading process is identical to an `assist_advanced_grading()` call

--

- If this process is interrupted, only the questions for the students the grader did regrade will have changed

---

class: middle

## Hands-on session: using regrading function

Regrading example

```{r, eval = FALSE}
assist_regrading(
  rubric_path = "rubric-full.csv", 
  grading_progress_log_path = "quiz01-grading-progress-log.csv", 
  final_grade_sheet_path = "quiz01-final-grade-sheet.csv",
  {{questions_to_regrade = c("Question 1", "Question 2"), }}
  {{students_to_regrade = "BaronPoisson"}}
)
```

Regrade either 2 questions for one student or 1 question for two students.

---

## Multiple submissions per student

The grading functions allow the provided assignment path to be a vector

<img src="figures/filepath-multiple-submissions.jpg" alt="A picture of a directory containing two sub directories names final-AlexYu and final-Ann-Lee. Each sub directory contains the files README.md and proposal.Rmd, which are highlighted.

.pull-right-large[

## Team grading with `assist_team_grading()`

.pull-left[
- For the case of multiple students per submission (e.g. group project)
- Students on a team share a feedback file and score

]

.pull-right[
